# Two-Nucleon-Bayesian-Analysis
Scripts that generate NN observables and analyze the convergence pattern and truncation error as in [arXiv:1704.03308](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03308).

This is very old code. All statistical code shown here has been refactored and made
reusable via [this](https://github.com/buqeye/gsum) package. Some of the two-nuclean results from this work
are reproduced in a Jupyter notebook in the [docs](https://buqeye.github.io/gsum/notebooks/truncation_recap.html).
See [arXiv:1904.10581](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10581) for details.
